My self-tracking work is an extensive dataset for EDA and machine learning analysis.  Know thyself. 


Notes on the dataset: 

- The following columns' data have been removed as they may contain sensitive information:  ['PositiveRetro', 'NegativeRetro', 'DailyGoals', 'Journal', 'WhyDrink', 'Evening', CovidPointsActivity']
- The 'WhereSleep' Column was manually modified to contain the following values ['Home', 'Partner', 'Traveling'] to indicate where I slept that night
- The 'PartnerContact' Column was manually modified to contain the following values ['0', '1', '2'] to indicate whether I slept alone, with a partner or in the same room as non-partners.   
- The 'Drugs' Column was manually modified to contain the following values ['0', '1', '2'] to indicate whether I ingested no substances, ingested substances for focus, ingestedsubstances for recreation.
